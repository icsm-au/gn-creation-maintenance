|**Provenance** | This standard was created in 2024 by the ICSM Geographical Naming Working Group after the publication of ISO's publication in 2023 of ISO19160-2 Assigning and maintaining addresses for objects in the physical world and in 2024 of ICSM's publication of its Address Model. This standard is a profile of the former and instructions in the production of data conformant to the latter.
