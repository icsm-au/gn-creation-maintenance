== Preamble

=== Scope

This document is a Profile of <<ISO19160-2, ISO 19160-2:2023, Addressing – Part 2: Assigning and maintaining addresses for objects in the physical world>>.

In the Australian context, this standard applies to thoroughfare-based addressing i.e. street and water, as well as landmark addressing. It is designed as a replacement for <<ANZ4819, AS/NZS 4819:2011 Rural and urban addressing>>. This standard does not apply to other address classes such as postal at this time. Postal addressing is expected to adhere to <<ASNZSISO19160-4, AS/NZS ISO 19160.4:2023 International postal address components and template language>>.

This document focuses on assigning and maintaining addresses that allow the unambiguous determination of an object in the physical world for purposes of identification and location in the context of public administration and public service delivery.

This standard provides requirements for addressing authorities to assign addresses, record the related information, and signage related to addressing components.

=== Normative References

[[access-point]] access point:: The position along a thoroughfare (road or water feature) where the public would normally access an address site. SOURCE: this standard

[[address]] address:: An address is structured information that allows the unambiguous determination of an object for purposes of identification and location (SOURCE: <<ISO19160-1, ISO 19160-1:2015>>). The objects exist in the physical world (i.e. virtual objects are excluded) and can be outdoor (e.g. a building) or indoor (e.g. an office inside a building). SOURCE: this standard

[[addressable-object]] addressable object:: Object that may be assigned an address. SOURCE: <<ISO19160-2, ISO19160-2>>

[[address-assignment-method]] address assignment method:: The way in which addresses are assigned according to the rules of an address reference system. SOURCE: <<ISO19160-2, ISO19160-2>>

[[address-authority]] address authority:: Agency responsible for assigning addresses. Usually a local government. SOURCE: <<ANZ4819, ANZ4819>>

[[address-class]] address class:: description of a set of addresses that share the same address components, operations, methods, relationships, and semantics. SOURCE: <<ISO19160-2, ISO19160-2>>

[[address-component]] address component:: constituent part of the address. These may reference another object such as a spatial object including and administrative boundary or land parcel, or a non-spatial entity. SOURCE: <<ISO19160-2, ISO19160-2>>

[[address-reference-system]] address reference system:: A defined set of address components and the rules for their combination into addresses. SOURCE: <<ISO19160-2, ISO19160-2>>

[[address-site]] address site:: a site for which an address is being assigned. SOURCE: <<ANZ4819, ANZ4819>>

[[alternative-address]] alternative address:: an assigned address that refers to an alternative access point to an address site. Requires a preferred address to have been assigned. SOURCE: this standard

[[alternative-name]] alternative name:: a name that is an alternative name to another name for the same feature. SOURCE: <<ANZ4819, ANZ4819>>

[[dual-name]] dual name:: a name that consists of two official names that must be used together, usually one indigenous and one European (e.g. ‘Aoraki/Mount Cook’). SOURCE: <<ANZ4819, ANZ4819>>

[[formed]] formed:: in relation to a road, means that it is physically constructed or prepared for passage by vehicles or pedestrians. SOURCE: <<ANZ4819, ANZ4819>>

[[geocode]] geocode:: a point feature for an address indicating a geometry. SOURCE: this standard

[[locality]] locality:: a named geographical area defining a community or area of interest, which may be rural or urban in character, and is usually a suburb in the latter case. SOURCE: <<ANZ4819, ANZ4819>>

[[IRI]] IRI:: Internationalized Resource Identifiers, IRIs, are a sequence of characters from the
   Universal Character Set. SOURCE: <<ISO10646, ISO10646>>

[[preferred-address]] preferred address:: the assigned address that is preferred for usage and refers to the main access point to an address site. SOURCE: this standard

[[primary-address-site]] primary address site:: an address site that is not contained within another address site. It may contain a sub-address site. SOURCE: <<ANZ4819, ANZ4819>>

[[profile]] profile:: set of one or more base standards or subsets of base standards, and, where applicable, the identification of chosen clauses, classes, options and parameters of those base standards, that are necessary for accomplishing a particular function. SOURCE: <<ISO19160-2, ISO19160-2>>

[[sub-address]] sub-address:: an address number element that refers to a sub-address site. SOURCE: This standard>>

[[sub-address-site]] sub-address site:: an address site that is contained within a primary address site e.g. an apartment within a building SOURCE: <<ANZ4819, ANZ4819>>. Sometimes referred to as a secondary address site. SOURCE: this standard

[[thoroughfare]] thoroughfare:: a road or named water feature from which an address site can be accessed. SOURCE: this standard

[[thoroughfare-address]] thoroughfare address:: an address that is assigned with reference to the thoroughfare it is accessed from, for example a road or water feature. SOURCE: this standard

=== Conformance

Keywords used to signify requirements in this document are those defined by <<RFC2119, RFC2119>> and they are:

* _MUST_
* _MUST NOT_
* _REQUIRED_
* _SHALL_
* _SHALL NOT_
* _SHOULD_
* _SHOULD NOT_
* _RECOMMENDED_
* _MAY_

For process and information to be conformant with this standard, the imperatives of those keywords _MUST_ be followed as per their <<RFC2119, RFC2119>> definitions.

Address information created following processes outlined in this standard _MUST_ conform to the <<ADDR2024, ICSM Address Model>> with conformance to it tested as per it's https://linked.data.gov.au/def/addr#AnnexB[Annex B: Validation] section.

=== Namespaces

Namespaces, in this document's context, are managed <<IRI, IRIs>> which allow further IRIs to be created within their scope. Namespaces are allocated to macro data objects and provide IRIs for all the micro data objects within that object.

For example, the IRI for the <<ADDR2024, Address Model>> is `+https://linked.data.gov.au/def/addr+` and the namespace of `+https://linked.data.gov.au/def/addr/+` (the Address Model's IRI + `/`) allows for IRIs to be created for elements within the model such as one for the `AddressableObject` class which is `+https://linked.data.gov.au/def/addr/AddressableObject+`.

When used in some forms of data and human-readable text, IRIs can either be written in full or in a shortened form using prefixes for known namespace. For example, the `Addresable Object` mentioned above can be written in full like this:

`+https://linked.data.gov.au/def/addr/AddressableObject+`

or in prefixed form with the prefix `addr` for the namespace `+https://linked.data.gov.au/def/addr/+` like this:

`addr:AddressableObject`

The prefixed namespaces used in this document are:
